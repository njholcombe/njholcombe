## Howdy

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the following:
-  Re-factoring pyOpAnalytics
-  Creating an AWS reusable datalake house framework
-  Creating resuable batch jobs for the datalake(stepfunctions, lambda, s2, Athena)
-  Creating resuable Kinesis streaming ingestion jobs for the datalake, ODS, and/or datawarehouse
- These are my newer repos.  My old is here: https://github.com/njh12
